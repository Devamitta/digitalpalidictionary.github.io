# Welcome to Digital Pāḷi Dictionary

Digital Pāḷi Dictionary is a feature-rich Pāḷi dictionary which runs in GoldenDict, or any other application that supports the Stardict format.

It is a work in progress, made available for testing and feedback purposes.

You can always download the latest version of DPD from [Github](https://github.com/digitalpalidictionary/digitalpalidictionary/releases).

Here's how to get GoldenDict installed and setup on your machine ([Win](install_win.html) / [Mac](install_mac.html) / [Linux](install_linux.html) / [Android](install_andoid.html))

Next, you should really [configure the hotkey](setup_hotkey.html) if you're on Windows or Mac, or try the [scan-popup](setup_scan_popup.html) if you're on Linux. This will allow you to click on any word in any Pāḷi text, and automatically open it in GoldenDict.

Once you're all setup, here's a handy guide to the [features](features.html) available in DPD. 

If you spot a mistake, or notice something missing, here's where to [report it](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9boBe7k5tCwq7LdWgBHHGIPVc4ROO5yjVDo1X5LDAxkmGWQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1433863141=digitalpalidictionary.github.io). It generally takes less than a minute. 

While you're at it, here are some [more Pāḷi dictionaries](https://github.com/simsapa/simsapa-dictionary/releases) to intall in GoldenDict. The *combined-dictionary-stardict.zip* contains all of them in one file.

Once you're all setup, [update](update.html) DPD every full moon to get the most up-to-date Pāḷi information.

There are some powerful [advanced features for Goldendict](goldendict_advanced.html) that might be useful to you.

If you have any bright ideas to make this dictionary even better, please [send me a mail](mailto:digitalpalidictionary@gmail.com).
