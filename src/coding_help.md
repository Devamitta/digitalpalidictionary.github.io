# Help with Coding

I am looking for some coding help. If you have the expertise and the interest, [please get in touch by email](mailto:digitalpalidictionary@gmail.com). If you know any coders, please share this webpage with them.

## JavaScript

I would to integreate DPD into [The Buddha's Words website](https://thebuddhaswords.net/home/index.html). There is currently a Pāḷi dictionary lookup system, but it is very outdated, the same one as on [Sutta Central](https://suttacentral.net/mn1/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=sidenotes&highlight=false&script=latin), which is very hit-and-miss. I have a devised a method to give [more accurate word-recognition](https://github.com/digitalpalidictionary/dpd-db/tree/main/tbw) and need some assistance with the JavaScript implementation. I don't see it will be very complex. Once created, the same system can be easily re-used in other websites. 

## Flutter

As a part of a longer-term vision, I would like to develop DPD into a Flutter App, which would replicate the current lookup functionality of GoldenDict, and further allow the integration of many requested features which are not possible within the GoldenDict framework.

The backend would be a SQLite database, and methods to lookup and present the relevant data.

This is a longer, more complex project. I am looking for help from an experienced Flutter devloper who can give guidance on the overall structure of such a project and suitable modules and methods to implement the DPD system.
