This feature is designed for beginners struggling with English to Pāḷi exercises, and more advanced students learning to communicate in Pāḷi. 

## Sinhala, Devanagari and Thai Scripts

Good news for those who read Pāḷi in Sinhala, Devanagara or Thai scripts, DPD recognises all inflected forms in all three of these scripts.

Transliteration is based on [Aksharamukha Script Converter](https://aksharamukha.appspot.com/about).

## Feedback

One of the most important aspects of DPD is the feedback loop. When you spot a mistake, please click the link to correct it. That opens up a Google form which is prefilled with the headword.

It generally takes less than a minute to log an error, and helps to improve the quality of the dictionary for everyone who uses it.

## Wikipedia links

All flowers, trees, plants and unusual animals contain a link to a Wikipedia article for more detailed information on the topic. Indian plants are often used in early Buddhist similes, and a picture is worth a thousand words.
