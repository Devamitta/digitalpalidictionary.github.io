# Coding Help Needed!

I am looking for some coding help. If you have the expertise and the interest, [please get in touch by email](mailto:digitalpalidictionary@gmail.com)

## JavaScript

I would to integreate DPD into [The Buddha's Words website](https://thebuddhaswords.net/home/index.html). There is currently a Pāḷi dictionary lookup system, but it is very outdated, it's the same as the one on Sutta Central. I have a devised a method to give [more accurate word-recognition](https://github.com/digitalpalidictionary/dpd-db/tree/main/tbw) and need some assistance with the JavaScript implementation. I don't think it will be very complex. Once created, the same system can be easily re-used in other wbsites. 

## Flutter

As a part of a longer-term vision, I would like to develop DPD into a Flutter App, which would replicate the current lookup functionality of GoldenDict, and further allow the integration of many requested features which are not possible within the GoldenDict framework. The backend would be a SQLite database, and methods to lookup and present the relevant data. This is a longer, more complex project.
